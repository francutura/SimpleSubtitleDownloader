# SimpleSubtitleDownloader

A simple GUI app I built in 2019, after an introductory course to object oriented programming, to download subtitles easily. Built with Java and using the opensubtitles [XMLRPC API](https://trac.opensubtitles.org/projects/opensubtitles/wiki/XMLRPC).

# How to run

An executable JAR file is provided in the project root SimpleSubtitleDownloader.jar

```java -jar SimpleSubtitleDownloader.jar``` should open the GUI of the application
